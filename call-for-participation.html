{% include relBase.html %}

<p>
  The W3C/OGC Joint Workshop Series on Maps for the Web
  will be a distributed, online meeting
  of developers, cartographers, policy makers, and
  other people with an interest in the future of Web standards
  relating to use of spatial information to display maps on the Web.
</p>

<p>The <a href="./#objective">objective</a> of the workshop series,
  its <a href="./#scope">scope</a>,
  and potential topics are outlined
  <a href="./">on the overview page</a>.
  Participants are welcome to suggest other topics within the scope.
</p>

<p>
  The workshop series will include both presentations and discussions.
</p>

<p>
  Presentations, demos, and panel sessions will be conducted as video-conferences
  (or optionally pre-recorded video presentations)
  which will be posted online for asynchronous viewing.
  Presentations will be grouped into themes, with one theme posted online per day.
</p>

<p>
  Discussion and questions will be via written forums over the course of a month.
  There will be discussions specifically around the presentations,
  as well as the possibility of participant-initiated discussion topics.
  In addition, we encourage people working on
  open source software or standards related to web maps
  to propose hack sessions
  to introduce their projects and invite feedback or collaboration.
</p>

<p>
  The workshop language is English.

<h2 id="talk-proposals">How can I suggest a presentation or panel session?</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this event is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.
  Presentations and panel discussions will be curated by the program committee
  to help provide background knowledge and experience needed to kick-start the conversation.
  Presentations will be short,
  and will be grouped into common themes
  to provide an array of perspectives on a topic.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to present on a topic,
  please <a
   href="#programming-committee">email the programming committee</a>
   a summary of your proposal, by the application deadline
  (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>).
</p>
<p>
  A good talk proposal should be concise (fewer than 600 words)
  and include the following information:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Who would be presenting.
  </li>
  <li>A short title or topic statement for the presentation.</li>
  <li>Whether you think this topic would be best served as
    a full (15 minute) presentation, a lightning talk, or a Q&A panel.
  </li>
  <li>Which of the <a href="./#topics">suggested topics</a>
    your presentation covers;
    or, for a new topic, how it relates to the <a href="./#scope">workshop series scope</a>.
  </li>
  <li>What unique information, experience, or perspectives
    you would provide.
  </li>
  <li>For live video chat panels,
    what times of day (in UTC timezone) are you available for?</li>
</ol>
<p>
  All suggested presenters should also fill out
  the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/1/maps2020/">attendee registration form</a>.
  Information from the form (including affiliations and biography or background)
  will be considered part of the proposal
  and may be included on the workshop series website,
  linked from the final talk description in the agenda.
</p>
<p>
  Our program committee will review the proposals and other application information
  to select the most relevant topics and diverse perspectives.
  If there are multiple submissions on similar topics,
  the committee may suggest modifying your proposal
  to focus on a unique aspect, or to shorten it for a lightning talk.
  Alternatively, multiple speakers on a single topic
  may be combined into a moderated panel discussion.
</p>
<p>
  Presenters are expected to provide copies of their slides
  or other relevant material in advance of their workshop
  (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>);
  these will also be published so that other participants might review them.
</p>

<h2 id="hack-day-proposals">How can I suggest a hack or demo project?</h2>
<p>
  In addition to the structured discussions on standardization,
  a secondary goal of the workshop series is to connect people
  from different areas of expertise in Web mapping,
  in a virtual hackathon.
</p>
<p>
  During the workshop series,
  we will host parallel tracks for demonstrating and hacking on web map projects,
  to spark new collaboration opportunities between workshop participants.
  Hack day sessions can focus on
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    solving specific software problems,
  </li>
  <li>
    gathering feedback from potential users of a software tool or dataset,
  </li>
  <li>
    building new demo projects with the project's tools or data,
  </li>
  <li>
    any other area of specialized discussion suitable for a breakout session.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The structure of the hack sessions could include
  video tutorials or other presentations,
  live video chat Q&A sessions, or
  written discussion forums.
  This is a new type of event, so we are open to other suggestions for structure.
</p>
<p>
  Hack day sessions can be proposed by sending an
  <a
  href="#programming-committee">email to the programming committee</a>
  with a summary of your proposal, by the application deadline
 (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>).
</p>
<p>
  A good hack session proposal should be concise (fewer than 600 words)
  and include the following information:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Who would be leading the session.</li>
  <li>A short title or topic statement for the session.</li>
  <li>What web map tools, geographic data sources, or other projects
    you'd be working with.
  </li>
  <li>How much background experience session participants should have.</li>
  <li>What your expected goals or outcomes for the session are.</li>
  <li>What structure do you think would work best to achieve those goals?
    If it would include live video chat sessions:
    what times of day (in UTC timezone) are preferred,
    and how many sessions would you be available for?</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Hack sessions should not be commercial sales pitches!
  If your session would include the use of a commercial tool or data source,
  please emphasize how it would focus on the use of open source
  or standardized tools or data as well.
</p>
<p>
  The program committee will review proposals with a focus
  on providing a set of sessions and projects that will be of interest
  to a wide variety of workshop participants.
</p>


<h2 id="position-statements">How can I provide a written position statement?</h2>
<p>
  Written position statements allow you or your organization
  to formally express your priorities or concerns
  with respect to the standardization of maps for the Web.
  They also allow all workshop participants
  to identify, in advance, areas of consensus or disagreement
  for discussion.
</p>
<p>
  Statements will be posted on the workshop website,
  and must be submitted by
  <a
  href="#programming-committee">email to the programming committee</a>,
  by the deadline for written submissions
 (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>).
</p>
<p>
  A good position statement should be between 200 and 1000 words,
  focus on the <a href="./#scope">scope of the workshop series</a>,
  and should include:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A brief overview of your experience or background, as it relates to Web maps.</li>
  <li>Which aspects of Web maps you think would benefit (or not) from standardization,
    and why.
  </li>
  <li>Any specific use cases or requirements you have for standardized Web maps.</li>
  <li>Examples of best practices you think should be followed
    (or worst practices that should be avoided).
  </li>
  <li>Links to related supporting resources:
    standards, research, reports, explainers, software projects, or datasets.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Position statements should focus on technical issues (what should be standardized),
  not the standardization process.
</p>

<h2 id="sponsorship">How can my organization sponsor the workshop series?</h2>
<p>
  We welcome additional sponsors
  to help us make the workshop series comprehensive and inclusive.
