<h1>Call For Participation</h1>
<p>
  This will be a three day workshop that brings together people with an interest
  in the future of Web standards relating to maps and spatial information on the
  Web.
</p>

<p>The scope of the workshop and potential topics are outlined
  <a href="/#scope">on the overview page</a>.
  However, participants are welcome to suggest other topics within the scope.
</p>

<p>
  The workshop will be two days of presentation and discussions, followed by one
  day of hands-on hacking, allowing participants to go in depth into proposals
  for further collaboration.
</p>

<p>
  The objective of the workshop is to establish a common vision among
  participants of how the Web platform could evolve to support accessible maps
  and spatial information.

  How can I suggest a presentation?</h2>
<p>
  This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short,
  with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program
  committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.
</p>
<p>
  In order to best facilitate informed discussion, we encourage attendees to
  read the accepted topics prior to attending the workshop.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to present on a topic, you should submit a position statement by
  the deadline (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>). Our program
  committee will review the input provided, and select the most relevant topics
  and perspectives.
</p>

<p>
  A good position statement should be a few paragraphs long and should include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submissions should be between 200 and 1000 words.</li>
  <li>Your background in the main topic areas of the workshop.</li>
  <li>Which topic you would like to lead discussion on.</li>
  <li>Links to related supporting resources.</li>
  <li>
    Any other topics you think the workshop should cover in order to be
    effective.
  </li>
  <li>
    A focus on technical issues, not process or platform preference. We plan to
    talk about the what, not the how.
  </li>
  <li>
    Position statements must be in English, preferably in HTML or plain-text
    format. You may include multiple topics, but we ask that each person submit
    only a single coherent position statement. The input provided at
    registration time (e.g., bio, goals, interests) will be published and linked
    to from this workshop page.
  </li>
</ul>
