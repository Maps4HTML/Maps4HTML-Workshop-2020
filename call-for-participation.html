<h1>Call For Participation</h1>
<p>
  The W3C Workshop on Maps for the Web
  will be a three day meeting of developers, cartographers, policy makers, and
  other people with an interest in the future of Web standards
  relating to use of spatial information to display maps on the Web.
</p>

<p>The scope of the workshop and potential topics are outlined
  <a href="./#scope">on the overview page</a>.
  However, participants are welcome to suggest other topics within the scope.
</p>

<p>
  The workshop will be two days of presentation and discussions,
  followed by one day of hands-on hacking and demonstrations,
  allowing participants to go in depth and spark collaboration.
  The workshop language is English.
</p>

<p>
  The objective of the workshop is to establish a common vision among
  participants of how the Web platform could evolve to support
  map-based Web experiences that embody best practices for Web users and website authors,
  while making use of standardized geographic and spatial data sources.
</p>

<h2 id="talk-proposals">How can I suggest a presentation or panel session?</h2>
<p>
  This is a workshop, not a conference, and any presentations will be short,
  with topics suggested by submissions and decided by the chairs and program
  committee. Our goal is to actively discuss topics, not to watch presentations.
</p>
<p>
  In order to best facilitate informed discussion,
  we encourage attendees to read the accepted topics
  prior to attending the workshop.
  Therefore, presenters should also submit written position statements
  or other material (e.g., slide decks) in advance of the event.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to present on a topic,
  please <a
   href="#programming-committee">email the programming committee</a>
   a summary of your proposal, by the application deadline
  (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>).
</p>
<p>
  A good talk proposal should be concise (fewer than 600 words)
  and include the following information:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Who would be presenting.
  </li>
  <li>A short title or topic statement for the presentation.</li>
  <li>Whether you think this topic would be best served as
    a full (15 minute) presentation, a lightning talk, or a Q&A panel.
  </li>
  <li>Which of the <a href="./#topics">suggested topics</a>
    your presentation covers;
    or, for a new topic, how it relates to the <a href="./#scope">workshop scope</a>.
  </li>
  <li>What unique information, experience, or perspectives
    you would provide.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  All suggested presenters should also fill out
  the <a class="todo" href="#how-to-participate">attendee application form</a>.
  Information from the form (including affiliations and biography or background)
  will be considered part of the proposal
  and may be included on the workshop website,
  linked from the final talk description in the agenda.
</p>
<p>
  Our program committee will review the proposals and other application information
  to select the most relevant topics and diverse perspectives.
  If there are multiple submissions on similar topics,
  the committee may suggest modifying your proposal
  to focus on a unique aspect, or to shorten it for a lightning talk.
  Alternatively, multiple speakers on a single topic
  may be combined into a moderated panel discussion.
</p>
<p>
  Presenters are expected to provide copies of their slides
  or other relevant material in advance of the workshop
  (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>);
  these will also be published so that other participants might review them.
</p>

<h2 id="hack-day-proposals">How can I suggest a hack day project or demo?</h2>
<p>
  The hack day is intended to spark new collaboration opportunities
  between workshop participants on web map projects.
  Hack day sessions can focus on solving specific software problems,
  gathering feedback potential users of a software tool or dataset,
  or building new demo projects with those tools and data.
</p>
<p>
  Hack day sessions can be proposed by sending an
  <a
  href="#programming-committee">email to the programming committee</a>
  with a summary of your proposal, by the application deadline
 (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>).
</p>
<p>
  A good hack session proposal should be concise (fewer than 600 words)
  and include the following information:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Who would be leading the session.</li>
  <li>A short title or topic statement for the session.</li>
  <li>What web map tools, geographic data sources, or other projects
    you'd be working with.
  </li>
  <li>How many participants you think you could effectively work with.</li>
  <li>How much background experience session participants should have.</li>
  <li>How long of a session is appropriate: 90 minutes, half day, or full day.</li>
  <li>What your expected goals or outcomes for the session are.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Hack day sessions should not be commercial sales pitches!
  If your session would include the use of a commercial tool or data source,
  please emphasize how it would focus on the use of open source
  or standardized tools or data as well.
</p>
<p>
  Because our venue space is limited,
  the program committee will review proposals with a focus
  on providing a set of sessions and projects that will be of interest
  to a wide variety of workshop participants.
</p>


<h2 id="position-statements">How can I provide a written position statement?</h2>
<p>
  Written position statements allow you or your organization
  to formally express your priorities or concerns
  with respect to the standardization of maps for the Web.
  They also allow all workshop participants
  to identify, in advance, areas of consensus or disagreement
  for discussion during the meeting.
</p>
<p>
  Statements will be posted on the workshop website,
  and must be submitted by
  <a
  href="#programming-committee">email to the programming committee</a>,
  by the deadline for written submissions
 (see <a href="#important-dates">important dates</a>).
</p>
<p>
  A good position statement should be between 200 and 1000 words,
  focus on the <a href="./#scope">scope of the workshop</a>,
  and should include:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A brief overview of your experience or background, as it relates to Web maps.</li>
  <li>Which aspects of Web maps you think would benefit (or not) from standardization,
    and why.
  </li>
  <li>Any specific use cases or requirements you have for standardized Web maps.</li>
  <li>Examples of best practices you think should be followed
    (or worst practices that should be avoided).
  </li>
  <li>Links to related supporting resources:
    standards, research, reports, explainers, software projects, or datasets.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Position statements should focus on technical issues (what should be standardized),
  not the standardization process.
</p>
