    Instructions for participants
  </h2>
  <p>
    The workshop focuses on topics raised by participants in expressions of interest and position statements.
    Each topic gets introduced by one or more short or lightning talk(s),
    and discussed among participants, possibly in smaller groups.
    The goal of each discussion at the workshop is not to resolve the technical issues of the topic,
    but to determine its relevance and priority to standardization.

      A typical discussion session (45-75 minutes) starts with a few talks by speakers nominated in advance.
      Talks will either be short (&lt;15 minutes) or <em>very</em> short (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talks</a>).
      They will be followed by a discussion among participants to exchange ideas, assess priorities, and identify possible standardization actions.

      Participants break into smaller breakout groups to discuss more specific topics,
      or to hack on software solutions.
      The breakout session schedule is built collaboratively by the participants in the course of the workshop.
      Each group will provide a written summary of their breakout session.
