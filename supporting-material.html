<p>
  The Maps for HTML Community Group is a W3C community of individuals and organizations who share the objective of extending HTML with maps and location. The community group is “iterating” on a variety of outputs, ranging from <a href="https://maps4html.github.io/HTML-Map-Element-UseCases-Requirements/">use cases and requirements</a>, to <a href="https://github.com/Maps4HTML/MapML-Proposal#the-mapml-proposal---explainermd">proposals</a>, <a href="https://geogratis.gc.ca/mapml/en/cbmtile/cbmt/">polyfills</a> and <a href="https://maps4html.github.io/MapML/spec/">specifications</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The motivation behind the Maps for HTML Community Group is the growing recognition of the importance of maps and location in decision-making at all levels, from individuals to humanity on a global scale. We see evidence of this in the growth of world-wide contributions to projects such as Open Street Map, as well as in the public investments by governments in open spatial data infrastructures. A negative aspect of this growth is the proliferation of incompatible APIs for creating and using maps and location.
</p>
<p>
  A key challenge in introducing a new standard for maps on the Web is to avoid creating a <a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/927:_Standards">more complex and 'siloed' environment for users</a>, while respecting <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles.html#TOII">the requirement of accessing existing content</a>. As such, the fundamental proposition of this workshop is to discuss the costs, benefits and means of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#pave-the-cowpaths">extending HTML</a> to include maps and location information in a <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">developer-</a> and user-oriented fashion.
