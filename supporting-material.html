<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>
  The unprecedented growth in Web map content is driven by factors such as advances
  in mobile computing, and a broad and growing recognition of the importance of
  the location of and visualization of spatial information in decision making.
  We see evidence of this in the growth of world wide contributions to projects
  such as Open Street Map, as well as in the public investments by governments
  in open spatial data infrastructures.
</p>
<p>
  From a standards perspective, the story of Web maps is mixed.
  The geospatial information community has, for more than two decades, developed
  standards and applications that support and secure the infrastructural
  investments that society has made, and is making, in geospatial content.
  Certainly, lessons about the ingredients for successful geospatial information
  standards have been learned, some the hard way.
</p>
<p>
  World wide, spatial data infrastructures and Web map content are accessed
  through services that implement OGC standards such as the Web Map Service
  (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS), Catalog Services, Web Map Tile Service
  (WMTS) and other standards. There is a distinct trend towards JSON-ified
  hypermedia API versions of all of these legacy standards, making this content
  accessible to Web developers in a simplified fashion. The recently published
  <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ogcapi-features"
    >OGC API - Features</a
  >
  standard is a response, in part, to the growing popularity of Web APIs. And
  yet, there are few dedicated Web platform standards to support and unify this
  growth. The support the Web platform offers is purely that of a scripted
  rendering platform, which results in a suboptimal use of resources by society
  by keeping the bar to using map content too high.
