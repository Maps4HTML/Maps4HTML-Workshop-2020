   Workshop particpants are invited to join the
   <a href="https://gitter.im/Maps4HTML/W3C-OGC-Workshop-Maps-For-Web">
   workshop gitter chat</a> to exchange information with other participants,
   and the program committee. You'll need either a GitHub, GitLab or Twitter
   account to join.

  from and for workshop participants.

<h2 id="position-statements">Participant and Position Statements</h2>

<p>
Position statements can be submitted on behalf of an organization,
or as an individual.
Either way, they should be short introductions,
to help other workshop participants understand your priorities and experience.

<h2 id="reports-explainers">Related Standards, Proposals and Other Reports</h2>

<p>
  Existing standards for online geospatial data provide relevant context;
  successful ones should be integrated into maps for the web,
  while less successful ones provide important warnings.
  Proposals can be compared and critiqued,
  to find the shared goals and strategies.
  Reports compiling requirements for different use cases
  provide a framework for measuring those proposals.

  MapML and related proposals from the Maps for HTML Community Group
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    The Maps for HTML Community Group is a W3C community
    of individuals and organizations who share the objective
    of extending HTML with maps and location.
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li><a href="https://maps4html.org/">Links and info</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A primary focus of work has been a proposal for
    a native HTML <code>map</code> element,
    and a matching markup-based map layer data format, MapML:

<dt id="maps4html-use-cases">
  Use Cases and Requirements for Standardizing Web Maps
</dt>
<dd>
  <p>
    An on-going effort by members of the Maps for HTML Community Group,
    to comprehensively summarize requirements for a native HTML web map viewer,
    by reviewing the capabilities of existing (JavaScript-based) map viewers
    currently used on the Web.

<dt id="OGC-standards">OGC standards for Web map services</dt>
<dd>
<p>
  World wide, spatial data infrastructures and Web map content are accessed
  through services that implement OGC standards, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms">Web Map Service (WMS)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/wfs">Web Feature Service (WFS)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/cat">Catalog Services</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/wmts">Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a distinct trend towards JSON-ified
  hypermedia API versions of all of these legacy standards, making this content
  accessible to Web developers in a simplified fashion. The recently published
  <a href="https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/ogcapi-features"
    >OGC API - Features</a>
  standard is a response, in part, to the growing popularity of Web APIs.

<h2 id="projects">Software Projects and Geospatial Data</h2>

<p>
Many organizations, both open/non-profit and commercial,
are actively working on Web map software and supporting data sets.
Their experience is essential for a standardization effort.
</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/geoposeswg">GeoPose</a> aims to be a
  universal standard for the geospatial position and orientation of any real or digital object.</p>

<p>The Open Geospatial Consortium's GeoPose community will hold a public
  <a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/#register/7527593462941704974">Webinar</a>
  on August 27th at 1100 EDT / 1500 UTC.</p>
