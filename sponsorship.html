  Details for potential sponsors of
  the W3C/OGC Joint Workshop on Maps for the Web, 15âˆ’17 June, 2020 in Montreal.

<section>
  <p>
    Location information is becoming increasingly important for human activity
    and survival. Web maps are an essential method of communicating location to
    users, across millions of Web sites and billions of people worldwide,
    especially on mobile platforms. Maps are the main medium of communicating
    location to users, and the lack of direct support for maps in the Web
    platform is an obvious barrier to adoption and growth of the mobile Web,
    when compared to proprietary platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    A W3C/OGC Joint Workshop is now planned for mid 2020 on emerging standardisation
    opportunities. This will be a three day workshop,
    including discussion sessions, presentations, and a hack day, that
    brings together people with an interest in the future of standards relating
    to maps and location, drawing upon the experience gained over the last two
    decades. The workshop will look at the emerging standardisation
    opportunities relating to the importance of location to the Web platform,
    and what's needed to better support maps for users and authors of all
    abilities.

    Sponsoring the W3C/OGC Joint Workshop on Web Map Standardization helps move the dialog
    forward.

    <h3 id="why">Why Sponsor This Workshop?</h3>
    <p>
      The cost to hold a workshop includes costs for venue (including setup and
      custodial costs), AV requirements (optionally including recording),
      catering (lunch and breaks), materials, travel and staffing, and other
      considerations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the planning, coordination, agenda building, and writing outcome
      reports are done for no cost by W3C staff or volunteers. But without
      sponsorships, W3C cannot hold workshops.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you see value in discussing the expected evolutions of
      Web technologies related to maps and geographic data,
      and believe it will help your business, sponsoring is
      the best way to ensure that this conversation happens, and that you are
      seen as a leader and a forward-looking enabler of the technical evolution
      of the Web.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more sponsorships we get, the better the amenities will be, including
      options like recording and transcription for spreading and preserving what
      was discussed, support to help more people participate,
      and nicer meals and social events.
